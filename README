Modded SelectCategoryTagCloud
=============================

This is a modified version of the Mediawiki extension SelectCategoryTagCloud, http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SelectCategoryTagCloud, as used on the GMOD wiki, http://gmod.org. This extension now works correctly on Mediawiki 1.19.2.

Modifications made:

- Titles (selectcategory-title, selectcategory-subtitle, selectcategory-boxlabel, etc.) now display and internationalization settings work;
- The error caused by using the deprecated messaging system (in the line $wgMessageCache->addMessages($messages)) has been fixed;
- Fixed the removal of trailing whitespace and addition of empty lines, as seen in D0li0's fix on the extension talk page;
- Removed the tab for the 'Category Hierarchy', since it doesn't exist;
- Tweaked the html and css a bit for a nicer visual experience;
- Removed unneeded JS and CSS files.

Any issues with the original extension that are not mentioned here probably still remain in this version. I fixed the issues that I found troublesome.
